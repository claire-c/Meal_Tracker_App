# Android Meal Tracker Application

## Project Objectives
After two weeks of Java and one week of Android, I was tasked with consolidating my learnings via a project brief set by CodeClan instructors. The goal of the project was to practice OO and UI design.

With six or seven projects to choose from, I decided to focus on an Android application, as less time had been spent on this framework and I felt it was a big learning opportunity.

### MVP
You are required to write an Android app that allows a user to track the food they eat. Users should be able to enter what they eat and when (date/time) and for what meal.

### Extension
The app should show the user a record of what they have eaten over a given period.

## Design Process

Before coding, I planned out my Java classes and relationships using UML diagrams. I looked at other meal tracking applications to get an idea of core functionality, and wrote personas, user journeys and user stories to assist with UX. I used a Trello board to plan the build.

I created wireframes and realised that I would only require four navigational elements. I decided to use a bottom navigation menu so the user would have a familiar and consistent experience.
